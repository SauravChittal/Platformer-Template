# Platformer-Template
#### Please note: You've to download pygame first in order for this to work

## Downloading the necessary files
After creating the folder where all this is going to be stored, make sure that you download [pygame-functions](https://github.com/StevePaget/Pygame_Functions) and make sure that the file `pygame_functions.py` is present within the folder where all the files in this repository are.

## Working
Make sure to have some fresh and awesome photos of all the things that you might want to include in your platformer in the folder where this repository is. Then open [fillerhere.py] and put the location of those photos in places which have been mentioned.

Finally, run `python3 [fillerhere.py]` in your command prompt and enjoy as you are greeted to a screen wherein you can play and platform all you want (Well, for 80 seconds, you can change that though).

## Adding your own twist
If you ever want to add your own twist to this platformer, feel free to. It has been explained fairly in detail about how one might go about adding more backgrounds or more enemies or rather more specialized enemire
